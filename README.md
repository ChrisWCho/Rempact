# Rempact (formerly reThink Healthcare) 
- Patient Transfer Board Prototype

This is a project I was apart of during my time at George Brown College (2019) as a student researcher.
This project was to develop a solution to an ongoing issue of long term back problems developed in nurses over years of transfering patients through the modern transfer boards.

The complete transfer board.
